# Face Tracking Using Arduino and Open CV
Face Tracking Using Arduino and Open CV library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision using Python. This Project aims to track peoples face when they are in range of the camera and move according to the tracking face and capture them whenever they track something. 

Things you will need:
1) Arduino
2) 2 Servo Motors
3) Web Cam
4) Pan & Tilt for servo

Installation Process:
install these libraries - opencv, numpy, pyserial.

Fire up the arduino and connect the servo to the board according to the code. Run the Servo.ino file and after that run the Face Tracking file.
